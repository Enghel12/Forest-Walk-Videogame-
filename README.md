## About the game

Forest Walk immerses players in a captivating first-person horror experience set within a mysterious, remote forest. You awaken suddenly among towering, shadowed trees with no recollection of how you arrived in this eerie wilderness. An introductory segment misleadingly directs you to search for a house that ultimately does not exist, further amplifying your sense of despair. Every rustle and whisper in the dense, mist-covered woods heightens the tension, propelling you deeper in search of answers. However, Forest Walk provides no traditional conclusion—its lack of a definite ending forces you into endless exploration, weaving an unsettling realization that you’re trapped in an unescapable wilderness
