## About the game

Forest Walk is a first-person horror game set in a desolate, remote forest. The player awakens alone in an unfamiliar wilderness, with only a nearby house to guide them. As they explore the house, they will uncover clues that slowly unravel the mystery behind their amnesia and the strange circumstances that led them to this eerie forest. Each discovery brings them closer to understanding why they woke up in this isolated placeâ€”and what dark secrets lie hidden within the woods.

Currently, Forest Walk is a prototype in development. While the landscape has been fully designed, the house, a key element of the game, has yet to be added. The game is still evolving, with ongoing work to bring the environment and story to life. Below are some screenshots showcasing the current look of Forest Walk, along with a short video to illustrate the gameplay and give you a glimpse of the experience.
